**Overview**

This project predicts the outcome of One Day International (ODI) cricket matches, focusing on whether the chasing team will win or lose. Using 20+ years of cricket data (2001‚Äì2024) from cricsheet.org, the system applies machine learning models‚Äîprimarily Random Forest, along with XGBoost and Linear Regression‚Äîto analyze match conditions, team performance, and in-game variables. A Flask-based web application allows users to input real-time match data and get instant win predictions, providing strategic insights for analysts, teams, and cricket fans.

**Objectives**

‚Ä¢	Predict ODI match outcomes based on the chasing team‚Äôs performance.
‚Ä¢	Incorporate historical match data, including team stats, toss results, and venue details.
‚Ä¢	Build a real-time, user-friendly web application.
‚Ä¢	Deliver accurate predictions (Random Forest achieves 91.60% accuracy).

**Features**


‚Ä¢	Data-Driven Predictions using historical ball-by-ball and match-level data.
‚Ä¢	Rich Feature Engineering including:
o	Runs Left, Balls Left, Wickets Left
o	Current & Required Run Rate
o	Target Score, Batting/Bowling Teams, Venue
‚Ä¢	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with interactive visualizations (Plotly, Seaborn).
‚Ä¢	Multiple Models Tested: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.
‚Ä¢	Local Flask Deployment for real-time predictions.

**üìÇ Dataset**
Source: Cricsheet.org
Period: 2001‚Äì2024 ODI Matches
Data Types:
1.	Match-level data ‚Äì Teams, venue, toss, result, player stats.
2.	Ball-by-ball data ‚Äì Runs, wickets, extras, dismissals, over/ball sequence.
Final Processed Dataset (winningPred) includes:
‚Ä¢	BattingTeam, BowlingTeam, city
‚Ä¢	runs_left, balls_left, wickets_left, target
‚Ä¢	current_run_rate, required_run_rate
‚Ä¢	result (1 = win, 0 = loss)

**üîç Methodology**

1. Data Collection & Cleaning
‚Ä¢	Aggregated JSON match files into structured DataFrames (df_matches, df_balls).
‚Ä¢	Removed redundant columns & handled missing values.
‚Ä¢	Cross-verified match and ball data integrity.

2. Feature Engineering
‚Ä¢	Calculated target scores.
‚Ä¢	Derived match state variables (Runs Left, Balls Left, Wickets Left, CRR, RRR).
‚Ä¢	Encoded categorical variables via One-Hot Encoding.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis
‚Ä¢	Visualizations:
o	Player of Match vs Runs/Wickets
o	Strike Rates, Sixes, Top Batsmen, Top Teams
o	Correlation Heatmap
‚Ä¢	Identified key patterns in match outcomes.

4. Model Training
Models Tested:

**Model	Accuracy	Precision	  Recall	 F1   Score**
Linear Regression	 84.69%	     0.33	   0.33	  0.34
Random Forest	     91.60%	     0.92	   0.90	  0.91
XGBoost	           89.07%	     0.89	   0.89	  0.89
Best Model: Random Forest ‚Äì robust, interpretable, low overfitting risk.

6. Deployment
‚Ä¢	Flask Web App:
o	Input: Batting Team, Bowling Team, City, Runs Left, Balls Left, Wickets Left, Target.
o	Output: Win probability & predicted winner.
‚Ä¢	Local deployment for testing.
‚Ä¢	Models saved with joblib for reuse.
